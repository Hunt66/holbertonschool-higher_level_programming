In this lession I will be learning about some diffrent types of data structures
and how to use them. These data structures include lists, tuples, dictionaries
and matricies. I will be learing about all of these in a python 3 environment.
I will be learning how to iterate through them, copy them, alter them and some
other things. This should be a fun lession.
