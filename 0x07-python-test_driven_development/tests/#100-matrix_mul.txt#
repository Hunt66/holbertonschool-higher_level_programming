The ``100-matrix_mul`` module
======================

Using ``matrix_mul``
-------------------

This is an example text file in reStructuredText format.  First import
``matrix_mul`` from the ``100-matrix_mul`` module:

    >>> matrix_mul = __import__('100-matrix_mul').matrix_mul


Now use it:

    >>> print(matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[1, 2], [3, 4]]))
    [[7, 10], [15, 22]]

    >>> print(matrix_mul([[1, 2]], [[3, 4], [5, 6]]))
    [[13, 16]]

    >>> print(matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[1, 2], [3, 4]]))
    [[7, 10], [15.9, 22.8]]

    >>> try:
    ...     print(matrix_mul("str", [[1, 2]]))
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    m_a must be a list

    >>> try:
    ...     print(matrix_mul([[1, 2]], "str"))
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    m_b must be a list

    >>> try:
    ...     print(matrix_mul([1, 2], [[1, 2]]))
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    m_a must be a list of lists

    >>> try:
    ...     print(matrix_mul([[1, 2]], [1, 2]))
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    m_b must be a list of lists

    >>> try:
    ...     print(matrix_mul([[1, 2, "str"]], [[1, 2]]))
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    m_a should contain only integers or floats

    >>> try:
    ...     print(matrix_mul([[1, 2]], [[1, 2, "str"]]))
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    m_b should contain only integers or floats

    >>> try:
    ...     print(matrix_mul([[1, 2], [1, 2, 3]], [[1, 3]]))
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    each row of m_a must should be of the same size

    >>> try:
    ...     print(matrix_mul([[1, 2], [1, 2]], [[1, 3], [1, 2, 3]]))
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    each row of m_b must should be of the same size

    >>> try:
    ...     print(matrix_mul([[1, 3], [1, 3]], [[1, 2]]))
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    m_a and m_b can't be multiplied

    >>> try:
    ...     print(matrix_mul([], [[1, 2]]))
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    m_a must be a list of lists

    >>> try:
    ...     print(matrix_mul([[1, 2]], []))
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    m_b must be a list of lists

    >>> try:
    ...     print(matrix_mul([[]], [[1, 2]]))
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    m_a can't be empty

    >>> try:
    ...     print(matrix_mul([[1, 2]], [[]]))
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    m_b can't be empty

    >>> try:
    ...     print(matrix_mul('str', [1, 2, 3]))
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    m_a must be a list

    >>> try:
    ...     print(matrix_mul('str', [[]]))
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    m_a must be a list

    >>> try:
    ...     print(matrix_mul('str', [[1, 2, 'str']]))
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    m_a must be a list

    >>> try:
    ...     print(matrix_mul('str', [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2]]))
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(e)
    m_a must be a list
